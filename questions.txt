Do you find the code to be simpler when using AngularJS? If so, how? If not, why?
	No, but thats becasue im not as familiar as I am with jquery.

Would a beginner to front-end development find the code to be simpler? Why or why not?
	I don't think a beginer would have an easy time with it. I think jquery has an easier learing curve even though its more
    verbose.

How might the structure provided by AngularJS simplify building larger web applications?
	It less verbose than jquery and seems more object oriented so it would help cutting down the code and making it concise.
